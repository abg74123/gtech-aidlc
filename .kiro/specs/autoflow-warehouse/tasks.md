# Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Tasks organized by vertical slices — each feature (Stock Count, Transfer, Write-off) is built end-to-end before moving to the next. Mock services and data layer are built first as shared foundation.

**Derived From**:
- Requirements: 4 user stories from `requirements.md` (US-022, US-023, US-024, US-025)
- Design: 5 components, 6 entities, 14 endpoints from `design.md`

**Strategy**: Vertical Slice (with shared foundation first)
**Rationale**: User chose vertical slice — each feature is self-contained and testable independently. Mock services + data layer built first as foundation for all slices.

## Execution Waves

Phases grouped by dependency resolution. Tasks within each phase are executed sequentially.

| Wave | Phases | Dependencies Resolved |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| 1 | [1. Project Setup & Mock Services] | None (foundation) |
| 2 | [2. Stock Count, 3. Stock Transfer, 4. Stock Write-off] | Wave 1 (mock services + data layer ready) |
| 3 | [5. Warehouse Module Integration] | Wave 2 (all backend features complete) |
| 4 | [6. Angular Frontend] | Wave 3 (backend wired and tested) |

### File Ownership Per Wave

**Wave 2** (parallel — 3 phases):
- Phase 2 (Stock Count): `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/services/stock-count.service.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/controllers/count-session.controller.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/dto/create-count-session.dto.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/dto/record-count-result.dto.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/__tests__/stock-count*`
- Phase 3 (Transfer): `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/services/stock-transfer.service.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/controllers/transfer.controller.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/dto/create-transfer.dto.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/__tests__/stock-transfer*`
- Phase 4 (Write-off): `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/services/write-off.service.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/controllers/write-off.controller.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/lib/dto/create-write-off.dto.ts`, `libs/warehouse/feature/src/__tests__/write-off*`

**Wave 4** (parallel — 3 UI phases):
- Task 6.2: `libs/warehouse/ui/src/lib/pages/count-session-*`
- Task 6.3: `libs/warehouse/ui/src/lib/pages/transfer-*`
- Task 6.4: `libs/warehouse/ui/src/lib/pages/write-off-*`

## Notes

**Technical Debt**:
- Mock services จะถูกแทนที่ด้วย real Master Data services เมื่อ Team 1 เสร็จ — ใช้ DI token swap
- File upload ใช้ local storage — migrate to S3 ใน production phase

**Future Enhancements**:
- Link กับ real Master Data services (separate task after team integration)
- Barcode scanning for stock count
- Batch transfer (multiple items in one request — already supported in design)
- Write-off reporting dashboard (Unit 4 — Reports team)
